# Toy car mp3 player
## About the project
My daughter's toy car played some music, but it was terrible loud and the songs were very annoying. I've decided to replace the built-in
music player circuit with a DIY mp3 player. The DFPlayer mini mp3 player is a very cheap module and can be controlled via serial port.
It has the advertisement feature, which is perfect for the toy car: when my daughter presses the horn button, the song will be interrupted,
the horn sound effect will be played, then the song can go on.
